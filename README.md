SEDA :- Stage Event Driven Arch.

my version of SEDA.

Overall ARCH.

WorkerContainer contains it's own queue and  processors threads
where container are interconnecting and there responsibility is to pass the messages as well as to run processors threads. 

Shall Refactor it. 
i) still have to pass the queue context to the next worker.
ii) multiple streams are still not available .
